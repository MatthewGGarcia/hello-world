# hello-world
I'm a new web developer. Just following the tutorial, trying to figure out GitHub
I started learning HTML in 6th grade in the mid to late 90's and have been dabbling in it eversince. I got up to HTML4 but never really explored CSS or JS. I started to get disconnected from writing web pages after html was turning into XHTML and as a youger person did not like that change. I decided to get back into web development as the love of creating things has never left me. I still know HTML quite well, and like what has happened with HTML5 coming on the scene instead of XHTML. I like coding much better now that I have discovered syntax highlighting text editors! No more coding from note pad! I decieded to double down on my web skills and learned js and css. I am still learning the ropes of js and css but they are pretty easy to understrand since they correlate with html. I eventually want to go into data visualization and other programming so I am aspiring to learn Python. However I also think that it is important to learn MySQL and PHP for the creation of more dynamic websites!
